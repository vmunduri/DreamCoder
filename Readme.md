# DreamCoder: Fork of the Original Repository

This is a modified version of [DreamCoder](https://github.com/ellisk42/ec), originally developed by Kevin Ellis and collaborators. The original repository implements a wake-sleep algorithm to find programs that solve tasks in a particular domain. This fork includes minor updates to the repository for improved compatibility.

## Modifications in this Fork

- **Updated Singularity files**:
  - Adjusted version dependencies for compatibility:
    - `yojson` updated to `1.6.0`
    - `menhir` updated to `20211128`
- Other files are unchanged from the original repository.
